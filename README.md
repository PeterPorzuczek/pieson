Pieson app
========
Example project of separate backend and frontend for my masters. Backend is written with Spring exposing REST API with OAuth authentiaction configured. Frontend written in Vue.js 2 with Vuestic components. Backend project uses the plugin to copy compiled Vue project and host it but you can turn it off and host only REST and frontend on other port/server.
